# Learning Python

## PYTHON INTRODUCTION

Python is a popular programming language.

Python can be used on a server to create web applications.

## WHAT IS PYTHON ?

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

![70fa523c20fd1ac614d08ff9521cff3c46_scaled_v1_400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76608611/136461420-d1e0b720-a611-484f-895b-e341f35d0e01.jpg)

It is used for:

- web development (server-side),
- software development,
- mathematics,
- system scripting.

## WHAT CAN PYTHON DO ?

- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

## WHY PYTHON ?

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

## GOOD TO KNOW THAT ...

- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
- In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.

## PYTHON SYNTAX COMPARED TO OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose

###### EXAMPLE 

```.py
print("Hello, Christ PrÃ©cieux")

```

## PYTHON QUICKSTART

Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:

> C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py

Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.

## PYTHON SYNTAX

Executing python syntax can be done by writing directly in the Command Line:
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World !

## PYTHON IDENTATION

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

###### EXAMPLE

```.py
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
```
However, Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

```.py
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
```

NB: The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.

```.py
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!")
```

In order to avoid any code issue, You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

```.py
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")
```

###### Python variables

In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

###### EXAMPLE

```.py
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

print(x)
print(y)
```

Python has no command for declaring a variable.
This will be learn more in Python Variable chapter

###### Comments

Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

```.py
# this is a comment
print("Nice to learn Python C'P!")
```

## PYTHON COMMENTS

Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

**Creating a Comment**

Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

```.py
# this is a comment
print("Python is fun!")
```

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:

```.py
print("Python is fun!") # this is a comment
```

A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

```.py
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Homie!")
```

###### Multi Line Comments

Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

```.py
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
```

Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

```.py
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.

## PYTHON VARIABLE

**Variable**

Variables are containers for storing data values.

**Creating Variables**

Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```.py
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

```.py
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```

**Casting**

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

```.py
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```

**Get the type**

You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

```.py
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
```

**Single or Double Quotes?**

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

```.py
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'
```

**Case-Sensitive**

Variable names are case-sensitive.

```.py
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
#This will create two variables:
```

**Variable Names**

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

###### EXAMPLE

Legal variable names:

```.py
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
```

Illegal variable names:

```.py
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
```

**NB: Remember that variable names are case-sensitive**

**Multi Words Variable Names**

Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

**Camel**

Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

```.py
myVariableName = "John"
```

**Pascal Case**

Each word starts with a capital letter:

```.py
MyVariableName = "John"
```

**Snake Case**

Each word is separated by an underscore character:

```.py
my_variable_name = "John"
```

**Assign Multiple Values**

**Many Values to Multiple Variables**

Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

```.py
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

**Note:** Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.

**One Value to Multiple Variables**

And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

```.py
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

**Unpack a Collection**

If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

Unpack a list:

```.py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

**Output Variables**

The Python print statement is often used to output variables.

To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:

```.py
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)
```

You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable:

```.py
x = "Python is "
y = "awesome"
z =  x + y
print(z)
```

For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

```.py
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
```

If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:

```.py
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)
```

**Global Variables**

Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.

Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

###### EXAMPLE

Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function

```.py
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()
```

If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.

**eg:** Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable

```.py
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

**The global Keyword**

Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.

To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

**example**

If you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope:

```.py
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.

**example**

To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword:

```.py
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

## PYTHON DATA TYPES

**Built-in Data Types**

In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	    str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	  dict
Set Types:	    set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	  bool
Binary Types:	  bytes, bytearray, memoryview

**Getting the Data Type**

You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:

```.py
x = 5
print(type(x))

#output
<class 'int'>
```

**Setting the Data Type**

In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

| example                                      	| data types 	|
|----------------------------------------------	|------------	|
| x = "Hello World"                            	| str        	|
| x = 20                                       	| int        	|
| x = 20.5                                     	| float      	|
| x = 1j                                       	| complex    	|
| x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]            	| list       	|
| x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")            	| tuple      	|
| x = range(6)                                 	| range      	|
| x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}            	| dict       	|
| x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}            	| set        	|
| x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"}) 	| frozenset  	|
| x = True                                     	| bool       	|
| x = b"Hello"                                 	| bytes      	|
| x = bytearray(5)                             	| bytearray  	|
| x = memoryview(bytes(5))                     	| memoryview 	|


**Setting the Specific Data Type**

If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions:

| Example                                      	| data type  	|
|----------------------------------------------	|------------	|
| x = str("Hello World")                       	| str        	|
| x = int(20)                                  	| int        	|
| x = float(20.5)                              	| float      	|
| x = complex(1j)                              	| complex    	|
| x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))      	| list       	|
| x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))     	| tuple      	|
| x = range(6)                                 	| range      	|
| x = dict(name="John", age=36)                	| dict       	|
| x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))       	| set        	|
| x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) 	| frozenset  	|
| x = bool(5)                                  	| bool       	|
| x = bytes(5)                                 	| bytes      	|
| x = bytearray(5)                             	| bytearray  	|
| x = memoryview(bytes(5))                     	| memoryview 	|


## PYTHON NUMBERS

There are three numeric types in Python:

- int
- float 
- complex

Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

```.py
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex
```

To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:

```.py
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

**Int**

Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

integers:

```.py
x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

**Float**

Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

```.py
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```
Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

```.py
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

**Complex**

Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:

```.py
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

**Type Conversion**

You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:

Convert from one type to another:

```.py
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
```

**Note:** You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.

**Random Number**

Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:

Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:

```.py
import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))
```

## PYTHON CASTING

**Specify a Variable Type**

There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

- int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
- float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
- str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

***Integers**

```.py
x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3
```

***Floats***

```.py
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2
```

***Strings***

```.py
x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'
```

## PYTHON STRINGS

1. STRINGS 

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function:

```.py
print("Hello")
print('Hello')
```

**Assign String to a Variable**

Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

```.py
a = "Hello"
print(a)
```

**Multiline Strings**

You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

You can use three double quotes:

```.py
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)
```

Or three single quotes:

```.py
a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
print(a)
```

Note: in the result, the line breaks are inserted at the same position as in the code.

**Strings are Arrays**

Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):

```.py
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])
```

**Looping Through a String**

Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.

Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

```.py
for x in "banana":
  print(x)
```

**String Length**

To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

The len() function returns the length of a string:

```.py
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))
```

**Check String**

To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.

Check if "free" is present in the following text:

```.py
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)
```

Use it in an if statement:

Print only if "free" is present:

```.py
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "free" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'free' is present.")
```

**Check if NOT**

To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.

Check if "expensive" is NOT present in the following text:

```.py
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("expensive" not in txt)
```

Use it in an if statement:
print only if "expensive" is NOT present:

```.py
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "expensive" not in txt:
  print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")
```

2. Slicing Strings

**Slicing**

You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):

```.py
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
```

**Note:** The first character has index 0.

**Slice From the Start**

By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:

Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included):

```.py
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])
```

**Slice To the End**

By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:

Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end:

```.py
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])
```

**Negative Indexing**

Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:

Get the characters:

From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)

To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):

```.py
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])
```

3. Modify Strings

Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.

**Upper Case**

The upper() method returns the string in upper case:

```.py
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.upper())
```

**Lower Case**

The lower() method returns the string in lower case:

```.py
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())
```

**Remove Whitespace**

Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.

The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:

```.py
a = " Hello, World! "
print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"
```

**Replace String**

The replace() method replaces a string with another string:

```.py
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))
```

**Split String**

The split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the list items.

The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:

```.py
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']
```

4. String Concatenation

To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.

Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:

```.py
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)
```

To add a space between them, add a " ":

```.py
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)
```

5. Format String

String Format

As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:

```.py
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
print(txt)
```

But we can combine strings and numbers by using the format() method!

The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are:

Use the format() method to insert numbers into strings:

```.py
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))
```

The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:

```.py
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
```

You can use index numbers {0} to be sure the arguments are placed in the correct placeholders:

```.py
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
```

6. Escape Character

To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.

An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

```.py
txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."
```

To fix this problem, use the escape character \":

The escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would not be allowed:

```.py
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
```

**Escape Characters**

Other escape characters used in Python:

| Code 	| Result          	|
|------	|-----------------	|
| \'   	| Single Quote    	|
| \\   	| Backslash       	|
| \n   	| New Line        	|
| \r   	| Carriage Return 	|
| \t   	| Tab             	|
| \b   	| Backspace       	|
| \f   	| Form Feed       	|
| \ooo 	| Octal value     	|
| \ooo 	| Hex value       	|


7. String Methods

Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.

**Note:** All string methods returns new values. They do not change the original string.

| Method         	| Description                                                                                   	|

## PYTHON BOOLEANS

**Boolean Values**

In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.

You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.

When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:

```.py
print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)
```

When you run a condition in an if statement, Python returns True or False:

Print a message based on whether the condition is True or False:

```.py
a = 200
b = 33

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")
```

***Evaluate Values and Variables***

The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return,

Evaluate a string and a number:

```.py
print(bool("Hello"))
print(bool(15))
```

```.py
x = "Hello"
y = 15

print(bool(x))
print(bool(y))
```

***Most Values are True***

Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.

Any string is True, except empty strings.

Any number is True, except 0.

Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

The following will return True:

```.py
bool("abc")
bool(123)
bool(["apple", "cherry", "banana"])
```

***Some Values are False***

In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.

The following will return False:

```.py
bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})
```

One more value, or object in this case, evaluates to False, and that is if you have an object that is made from a class with a __len__ function that returns 0 or False:

```.py
class myclass():
  def __len__(self):
    return 0

myobj = myclass()
print(bool(myobj))
```

***Functions can Return a Boolean***

You can create functions that returns a Boolean Value:

Print the answer of a function:

```.py
def myFunction() :
  return True

print(myFunction())
```

You can execute code based on the Boolean answer of a function:

Print "YES!" if the function returns True, otherwise print "NO!":

```.py
def myFunction() :
  return True

if myFunction():
  print("YES!")
else:
  print("NO!")
```

Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value, like the ***isinstance()*** function, which can be used to determine if an object is of a certain data type:

Check if an object is an integer or not:

```.py
x = 200
print(isinstance(x, int))
```

## PYTHON OPERATORS

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

```.py
print(10 + 5)
```

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators

***Python Arithmetic Operators***

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

| Operator | Name           | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| +        | Addition       | x + y   |
| -        | Subtraction    | x - y   |
| *        | Multiplication | x * y   |
| /        | Division       | x / y   |
| %        | Modulus        | x % y   |
| **       | Exponentiation | x ** y  |
| //       | Floor division | x // y  |

***Python Assignment Operators***

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

| Operator 	| Example 	| Same As    	|
|----------	|---------	|------------	|
| =        	| x = 5   	| x = 5      	|
| +=       	| x += 3  	| x = x + 3  	|
| -=       	| x -= 3  	| x = x - 3  	|
| *=       	| x *= 3  	| x = x * 3  	|
| /=       	| x /= 3  	| x = x / 3  	|
| %=       	| x %= 3  	| x = x % 3  	|
| //=      	| x //= 3 	| x = x // 3 	|
| **=      	| x **= 3 	| x = x ** 3 	|
| &=       	| x &= 3  	| x = x & 3  	|
| \|=      	| x \|= 3 	| x = x \| 3 	|
| ^=       	| x ^= 3  	| x = x ^ 3  	|
| >>=      	| x >>= 3 	| x = x >> 3 	|
| <<=      	| x <<= 3 	| x = x << 3 	|

***Python Comparison Operators***

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

| Operator 	| Name                     	| Example 	|
|----------	|--------------------------	|---------	|
| ==       	| Equal                    	| x == y  	|
| !=       	| Not equal                	| x != y  	|
| >        	| Greater than             	| x > y   	|
| <        	| Less than                	| x < y   	|
| >=       	| Greater than or equal to 	| x >= y  	|
| <=       	| Less than or equal to    	| x <= y  	|

***Python Logical Operators***

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

| Operator 	| Description                                             	| Example               	|
|----------	|---------------------------------------------------------	|-----------------------	|
| and      	| Returns True if both statements are true                	| x < 5 and x < 10      	|
| or       	| Returns True if one of the statements is true           	| x < 5 or x < 4        	|
| not      	| Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true 	| not(x < 5 and x < 10) 	|


***Python Identity Operators***


Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

| Operator 	| Description                                            	| Example    	|
|----------	|--------------------------------------------------------	|------------	|
| is       	| Returns True if both variables are the same object     	| x is y     	|
| is not   	| Returns True if both variables are not the same object 	| x is not y 	|

***Python Membership Operators***

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

| Operator 	| Description                                                                      	| Example    	|
|----------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------	|
| in       	| Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object     	| x in y     	|
| not in   	| Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object 	| x not in y 	|

***Python Bitwise Operators***

Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

| Operator 	| Name                 	| Description                                                                                             	|
|----------	|----------------------	|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| &        	| AND                  	| Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1                                                                   	|
| \|       	| OR                   	| Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1                                                              	|
| ^        	| XOR                  	| Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1                                                         	|
| ~        	| NOT                  	| Inverts all the bits                                                                                    	|
| <<       	| Zero fill left shift 	| Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off                        	|
| >>       	| signed right shift   	| Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off 	|


## PYTHON LISTS

```.py
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

**List**

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:


```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
```

**List Items**

List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

**Ordered**

When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

**Note:** There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

**Allow Duplicates**

Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:

Lists allow duplicate values:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
```

***List Length***

To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:

Print the number of items in the list:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))
```

***List Items - Data Types***

List items can be of any data type:

String, int and boolean data types:

```.py
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]
```

A list can contain different data types:

A list with strings, integers and boolean values:

```.py
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
```

**type()**

From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':

***<class 'list'>***

```.py
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))
```

**The list() Constructor**

It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.

Using the list() constructor to make a List:

```.py
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)
```

**Python Collections (Arrays)**

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
- Dictionary is a collection which is ordered* and changeable. No duplicate members.


*As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.


When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.

**ACCESS LIST ITEMS**

Access Items:

List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:

Print the second item of the list
```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1])
```

Note: The first item has index 0.

**Negative Indexing**

Negative indexing means start from the end

-1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

Print the last item of the list:
```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[-1])
```

**Range of Indexes**

You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.

When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.

Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:5])
```

**Note:** The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).

Remember that the first item has index 0.

By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:

This example returns the items from the beginning to, but NOT including, "kiwi":

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[:4])
```

By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:

This example returns the items from "cherry" to the end:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:])
```

***Range of Negative Indexes***

Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:

This example returns the items from "orange" (-4) to, but NOT including "mango" (-1):

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[-4:-1])
```

**Check if Item Exists**

To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:

Check if "apple" is present in the list:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if "apple" in thislist:
  print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list")
```

**Change List Items**

***Change Item Value***

To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:

Change the second item:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)

***Change a Range of Item Values***

To change the value of items within a specific range, define a list with the new values, and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the new values:

Change the values "banana" and "cherry" with the values "blackcurrant" and "watermelon":
```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"]
thislist[1:3] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)
```

If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:

Change the second value by replacing it with two new values:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:2] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)
```

***Note:*** The length of the list will change when the number of items inserted does not match the number of items replaced.

If you insert less items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:

Change the second and third value by replacing it with one value:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:3] = ["watermelon"]
print(thislist)
```

**Insert Items**

To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.

The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:

Insert "watermelon" as the third item:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(2, "watermelon")
print(thislist)
```

***Note:*** As a result of the example above, the list will now contain 4 items.

**Add List Items**

***Append Items***

To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:

Using the append() method to append an item:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.append("orange")
print(thislist)
```
***Insert Items***

To insert a list item at a specified index, use the insert() method.

The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:

Insert an item as the second position:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(1, "orange")
print(thislist)
```

***Note:*** As a result of the examples above, the lists will now contain 4 items.

**Extend List**

To append elements from another list to the current list, use the extend() method.

Add the elements of tropical to thislist:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
tropical = ["mango", "pineapple", "papaya"]
thislist.extend(tropical)
print(thislist)
```

The elements will be added to the end of the list.

**Add Any Iterable**

The extend() method does not have to append lists, you can add any iterable object (tuples, sets, dictionaries etc.).

Add elements of a tuple to a list:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thistuple = ("kiwi", "orange")
thislist.extend(thistuple)
print(thislist)
```

**Remove List Items**

**Remove Specified Item**

The remove() method removes the specified item.

Remove "banana":

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.remove("banana")
print(thislist)
```

**Remove Specified Index**

The pop() method removes the specified index.

Remove the second item:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.pop(1)
print(thislist)
```
If you do not specify the index, the pop() method removes the last item.

Remove the last item:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.pop()
print(thislist)
```

The del keyword also removes the specified index:

Remove the first item:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
del thislist[0]
print(thislist)
```

The del keyword can also delete the list completely.

Delete the entire list:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
del thislist
```

**Clear the List**

The clear() method empties the list.

The list still remains, but it has no content.

Clear the list content:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.clear()
print(thislist)
```

**Loop Lists**

**Loop Through a List**

You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:

Print all items in the list, one by one:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
  print(x)
```

**Loop Through the Index Numbers**

You can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number.

Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

Print all items by referring to their index number:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
  print(thislist[i])
```
  
The iterable created in the example above is [0, 1, 2].

**Using a While Loop**

You can loop through the list items by using a while loop.

Use the len() function to determine the length of the list, then start at 0 and loop your way through the list items by refering to their indexes.

Remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration.

Print all items, using a while loop to go through all the index numbers

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
  print(thislist[i])
  i = i + 1
```

**Looping Using List Comprehension**

List Comprehension offers the shortest syntax for looping through lists:

A short hand for loop that will print all items in a list:

```.py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
```
